This will eventually be a world generator and simulation tool. I'm aiming more
for versimilitude than accuracy as this is being used for gaming and writing
rather than any sort of actual science.

## Installation

`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make && make install`

## Usage

- Generate Geodesic Base Data: `subdivide [iterations]`
